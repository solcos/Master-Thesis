## Bioinformatics approach to identify genes whose tumour expression shows a dual association with patient outcome

## ABSTRACT

The expression and/or function of many human genes has been associated with cancer progression. Typically, these studies identify overexpression or underexpression of a given gene as associated with patient survival and/or disease progression. However, a substantial minority of genes have an impact on cancer progression that is non-monotonic; that is, their effect direction and magnitude change on time, disease status, applied therapy and/or on other disease factors. Systematic identification of this type of genes can provide new fundamental insights on cancer drivers. Here, we have developed an approach to identify this class of genes, allowing us to initially define their functions and molecular interactions. This appraoch is applicable to any cancer type and has the promise to reveal unappreciated cancer gene drivers.
